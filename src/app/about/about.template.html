<h3 class="about-h3">About NM Outdoors</h3>
<p class="about-par">We're glad you've visited NM Outdoors! Our goal with this web application is to serve outdoor enthusiasts everywhere in their search for recreational areas in the great state of New Mexico, and find activities associated with those sites. We invite users to also create profiles within the application and leave ratings and comments on recreational areas as a way to contribute information to the local outdoor community.</p>
